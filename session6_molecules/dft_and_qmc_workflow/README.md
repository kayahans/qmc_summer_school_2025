# Example molecular workflow

Building on the Session 4 molecular examples, this workflow processes a set of similar molecules. For every structure input, it runs
through a series of DFT approximations, and for a subset of these it performs a VMC and DMC workflow.

The same statistics and choice of trial wavefunction form are used for all calculations. Therefore, all the input molecules are
expected to be similar in electron counts, elements, and electronic structure (etc.)
